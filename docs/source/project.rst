Project Summary
===============

Problem
-------
- It has become paramount for the Chemical Department to reduce the response time to incidents they receive.

- A big part of this is the repetitive nature of these incidences.

- Another factor is the isolated knowledge that is required to solve these problems.

Solution
--------
- Our mission is to eliminate isolated knowledge, which depends on individuals to solve problems.

- We want the incident response system to be more efficient and quick

- To supply a possible solution from similar problems and a quick categorization of a given problem

- Use Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing.

How
---
* Classifying and Recommender System
    - That will categorize problems into departments and sub-departments to suggest accountability for a given problem.
    - Will suggest similar past problems to suggest actions and solutions to the current investigator.
* AIM Website
    - An easy-to-use web app for investigators to manage their incidences. â€‹
    - Upload pre-made excel reports or fill in a standardized Web Form instead.
    - Receive suggestions from past problems and check any incidence in the online database.
